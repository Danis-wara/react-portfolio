# React Portfolio for Automation Engineering Student

## Description

This project is a modern, fully responsive, single-page portfolio website designed for a student or professional in the field of Automation Engineering Technology. It showcases personal information, technical skills, and featured projects in a clean, high-tech themed interface. The design is inspired by modern development portfolio templates and is built to be easily customizable and deployable.

## Technologies Used

* **Frontend:** React.js
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (loaded via CDN for simplicity)
* **Deployment:** Netlify

## Features

* **Modern & Thematic Design:** A dark mode interface with cyan accents and subtle circuit board animations to reflect the automation and engineering theme.
* **Fully Responsive:** The layout adapts seamlessly to all screen sizes, from mobile phones to desktop monitors.
* **Component-Based Structure:** Built with React components for easy management and updates.
* **Single-Page Navigation:** Smooth scrolling between sections (About, Skills, Projects, Contact).
* **Dynamic Content:** All personal data (name, skills, project details) is managed in a single `portfolioData` object for easy customization.
* **Continuous Deployment:** Integrated with GitHub for automatic updates on Netlify whenever new changes are pushed.

## Setup Instructions

To run this project locally on your machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Danis-wara/react-portfolio.git](https://github.com/Danis-wara/react-portfolio.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd react-portfolio
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    This project uses `create-react-app`, so you need to install the required Node.js packages.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Run the development server:**
    This command will start the application on `http://localhost:3000`.
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

5.  **Customize your content:**
    Open `src/App.js` in your code editor and modify the `portfolioData` object with your personal information. The website will update automatically as you save your changes.

## AI Support Explanation

This project was developed in collaboration with a large language model (AI). The process involved:

* **Initial Code Generation:** The AI generated the foundational React components and the overall structure of the single-page application based on a detailed prompt.
* **Iterative Debugging:** The AI provided assistance in troubleshooting and resolving various technical issues, including dependency conflicts, styling compilation errors, and environment-specific command syntax for Windows.
* **Refinement and Feature Addition:** The AI helped refine the code by adding new features (such as a profile photo, new sections, and updated content) and improving the code structure for better readability and maintainability. This collaborative approach significantly accelerated the development and debugging process.
